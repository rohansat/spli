# AI Auto-Fill Functionality Guide

## Overview

The SPLI application now includes advanced AI-powered auto-fill functionality that can automatically populate Part 450 license application forms based on mission descriptions provided by users. This feature significantly reduces the time and effort required to complete FAA Part 450 applications.

## How It Works

### 1. Mission Description Input
Users can provide a comprehensive mission description in the AI chat, and the system will automatically:
- Analyze the description for relevant information
- Extract specific details for each Part 450 form section
- Populate the form fields with the extracted information
- Save the updated form data

### 2. AI Processing
The AI system uses advanced natural language processing to:
- Identify mission types (satellite, suborbital, orbital, etc.)
- Extract vehicle specifications (stages, propulsion, dimensions, mass)
- Determine launch sites and timing information
- Identify safety considerations and risk assessments
- Extract technical details and specifications
- Determine timeline and licensing information

### 3. Form Field Mapping
The system maps extracted information to specific Part 450 form fields across all 7 sections:
- **Section 1: Concept of Operations (CONOPS)**
- **Section 2: Vehicle Overview**
- **Section 3: Planned Launch/Reentry Location(s)**
- **Section 4: Launch Information**
- **Section 5: Preliminary Risk or Safety Considerations**
- **Section 6: Timeline & Intent**
- **Section 7: List of Questions for FAA**

## Usage Examples
