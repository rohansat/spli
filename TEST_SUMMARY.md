# AI Application Filling Test Summary

## Mission Description for Testing

**Project: StellarSat-1 Commercial Satellite Launch**

We are planning to launch a 250kg Earth observation satellite called StellarSat-1 into low Earth orbit. The mission will deploy a high-resolution imaging satellite for environmental monitoring and disaster response applications.

**Launch Vehicle**: Two-stage Falcon 9 rocket with Merlin 1D engines using RP-1/LOX propulsion. The vehicle is 70 meters tall with a 3.7-meter diameter fairing. First stage uses 9 Merlin engines, second stage uses 1 Merlin vacuum engine.

**Launch Site**: Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Florida (28.5729° N, 80.6490° W). Launch Complex 40 operated by SpaceX.

**Mission Timeline**: 
- Application submission: Q2 2024
- Launch window: Q3 2024 (July-September)
- Mission duration: 5 years in 500km sun-synchronous orbit

**Safety Considerations**: 
- Flight termination system with redundant command destruct capability
- Real-time trajectory monitoring and range safety coordination
- Contingency landing zones in Atlantic Ocean
- Public safety exclusion zones during launch

**Ground Operations**: 
- Pre-launch vehicle processing and fueling at LC-40
- Payload integration and fairing encapsulation
- Static fire test 2 days before launch
- Crew access and countdown operations
- Post-launch vehicle recovery and refurbishment

**Technical Specifications**:
- Payload mass: 250kg
- Orbit: 500km sun-synchronous
- Inclination: 98 degrees
- Mission life: 5 years
- Power: Solar arrays with 2kW capacity
- Communication: S-band and X-band telemetry

**Recovery Systems**: First stage returns to Landing Zone 1 at Cape Canaveral, fairing recovery by drone ships in Atlantic.

**License Type**: Commercial launch license for satellite deployment under FAA Part 450.
